You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

## Team name
⟹ Sitecore-Geeks

## Category
⟹ N/A.

## Description
⟹ Integration Idea: Created a support chatbot that integrates with 
Sitecore Hackathon website to provide immediate answers to queries.
How to Integrate: The Content of the website is crawled and the output is in queries.json. 
This file is integreated via the NextJS Application and the Conversational Chatbot is created.
Benefit: A self-service application where the Content can be from any site and the application can be integrated as any Link into head apps.


  - Module Purpose -
    The purpose of this module is to create a self-service conversational chatbot that can be easily integrated with any website, such as the Sitecore Hackathon website. By crawling the content of the website and storing it in a queries.json file, the module enables the chatbot to provide immediate answers to user queries. The chatbot can be easily embedded into other applications or platforms, offering users an interactive and efficient way to access website content without needing to manually search for information.


  - What problem was solved (if any)
     The problem this module addresses is the difficulty users often face in finding specific information quickly on websites, especially when there's a large amount of content. Without an intuitive way to search or interact with the website, users may struggle to find answers to their queries or navigate the content efficiently.

    - How does this module solve it
       This can be widely used where there is no search functionality integrated such as Sitecore Hackathon website.
